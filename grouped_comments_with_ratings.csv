Our trip leader did a great job pivoting and lining up alternatives when faced with a challenging weather situation.  In fact, I think the March 18 selection was one that should be in the itinerary - great day with a hike, snorkeling and beach time. The willingness and ability of the captain and crew in being willing to pivot was also instrumental to ensuring a great trip. The food was amazing as well - every day, every meal. naturalists were very helpful/ captain's flexibility when faced with high winds and determination to move the ship to a location where we could still have experiences.

I obtained a key to my cabin from the purser. No lit overhead Exit signs were in halls. No man overboard instructions provided, no life boat drills. No idea where lifeboats were kept or how to get to them. I had a medical incident, out of the blue, as the ship was disembarking. The tour director, staff and doctor were outstanding. Somehow managed to stabilize me and summon a Van to get me to a clinic where tests could be administered. The doctor held my head, gave me oxygen and talked to keep me awake the whole 2 hours to the clinic. Exceptional handling of a difficult situation. All crew and staff above expectations.

quality of food The Naturalists.  I was so impressed with their patience with the travelers.  We had several seniors with mobility issues and staff could not have been more accommodating. Its a good look for when we will need the extra help.  The activities were well planned and implemented.
The food and hotel service was excellent.
Information provided before the trip with the cruise portion of the voyage was helpful and complete.
And we enjoyed photo experience with the flora and fauna. The staff and naturalists were generally very good As usual, the naturalists were all outstanding, all with a wealth of knowledge about the flora, fauna and history. Every event went off on time, and there were excellent explanations of how each day would unfold.  The trip through the Canal was the highlight for me, having been on my ""bucket list.""  By far the best Zodiac/Panga ride was an unscheduled trip to a portion of Gatun Lake while the Quest was anchored awaiting release to the Gatun locks. Everything was great Great crew The Panama Canal, snorkeling, kayaking, visit to Hearts of Palm plantation, Zodiac tours The staff was excellent.  We were older passengers and the staff were very concerned about our safety on all of the outings.

The ship staff were very well trained and ""our wish was their command"".

We enjoyed all of the naturalists.  Not only were they very knowledgeable, but also very personable.

The movie and talks before entering the Panama Canal were great.  The Panama Canal was a real high light and filled an item on the ""bucket list"". Typical well-run Lindblad trip, the excursions off the ship were enjoyable and informative, and the expedition leader and her assistant did a superb job 1) The destinations. Each place we visited was interesting and different

2) the extraordinary organization required for all the experiences 

3) the amazing teamwork of the crew and staff 

4) Tamryn helped us with a significant problem in our cabin by upgrading us. Now
Well never want the low grade cabins again

5) the free beer and wine. This is new

Morgan the photographer was wonderful.  My camera broke and she had one I could use and helped me with its quirks. Food. Staff. Accomdations. Passage through the Panama Canal. Good snorkeling, lots of wild life (especially birds and monkeys) I liked the hiking/walking tours in the rain forest.  The naturalist guides were well trained and most of them were very friendly.  The talks before dinner were interesting and the sharing of photos.  The outdoor area of the ship was very nice. Going through the Panama Canal The guides were outstanding--I worked with Frank Simms, the photography instructor, primarily, but all were terrific.  Our underwater specialist, the naturalist Isa ... can't list them all, but the quality was consistently high and the atmosphere among them (and with us) was very collegial and relaxed.  I liked the fact that some of the naturalists joined the guests for meals, as well.  Great way to create deeper bonds.  The guest photo show at the end was a great idea, too. The naturalists, especially that they were nearly all local to Panama or Costa Rica. The food! The library. The terrific staff. We loved everything! The exciting excursions, the attention to safety, the kind staff, the well-appointed boat, the food, the scientific information we learned, the fun! Our room was spacious with plenty of storage, a very good shower and toilet, attractively and cleanly appointed and with the ability to open the door to the outside balcony.  The staff was energetic, professional and fun!  The emphasis on safety was reassuring and confidence building.  The activities were varied in level of ability and well described.  The food was delicious and healthy. The guided hikes. Some were rigorous but all were intensely intimate with the rain forest. The guides were both good teachers and passionate about the ecology. The snorkeling was a success and we had very little previous experience. 
We also liemthe near daily Zodiac rides. Lots of interesting information, knowledgeable experts, good food and accommodations. Loved: the excursions (including zodiac boat rides), almost all the naturalists, all the staff (very friendly, helpful, and hardworking to make our experience special), the food (especially how well they accommodated our dietary restrictions), our room (it was small but well appointed). We want to give special shoutouts to Cesar, Isa, and Jose.  We loved every excursion we went on with them! They were not only knowledgeable but also loved the land and people and it showed in the tours they led. well organized, stellar staff, good food, interesting places to visit, knowledgable guides, adequate accommodations enthusiasm and knowledge of NG guides onboard
courteous and excellent service of experienced staff It was beautiful. People, services , food, General environment Activities and staff excellent I loved the stories that the naturalists told both during talks and other activities. I also loved the food. 
The sugar cane/gold mine  and cacao excursions were amazing! We liked everything about this trip except the tragic accident that killed a guide and put both the trip leader and a passenger in the hospital. Everyone on the ship performed extremely well, but the guide who replaced the trip leader on an emergency basis disserves particular praise. The passengers and crew gave both her and the ship's doctor well-deserved standing ovations at the end of the cruise.",4.321428571428571

Locations visited
Thoroughness Being in remote areas with trained naturalists.  Sharing the experience with like-minded explorerers.  The comfort of the expedition ship. My family truly loved this trip of a lifetime. Starting with Nancy in the call center and her helpful suggestions and answers. The actual travel from Miami to the Galapagos and back; the accommodations, every one of the staff from Gabby to naturalists to housekeeping to dining, the knowledge, the food, the theme nights, presentations, staff communication, excursions. Everything was first class, first rate. We felt safe at all times and the friendships we made were so special. Thank you. The naturalists were excellent, as was the location. The tours were very well planned. The schedule was very well done, with options and lots of room for people to get their options. Cabin cleaning was very good and quietly done at times good for us. The food was excellent with good choices at every meal. The tour was well planned with us seeing the best locations and animals in the Galapagos. The naturists were very knowledgeable and great story tellers. The zodiac drivers were careful, helpful and very nimble in their steering. The way the Galapagos was presented to us was excellent. Other than the people on the ship, who were wonderful, we didn't see humans for 5 days. The naturalists explained everything we saw and heard in accessible fashion and even though they had done it thousands of times made it seem like we were their first tour. It was like visiting our world before humans arrived. The wildest place I have ever been. Very insightful naturalists. Crew and service was top quality. Emphasis on ecosystem, conservation, science, uniqueness of the Galapagos islands, quality of staff, broad range of activities across multiple islands Logistics and attitude of the guides and ships crew were outstanding.  All exuded a very positive attitude and I always felt safe on the daily excursion. Organization The expeditions on the zodiacs absolutely felt like adventures - we were the only humans on the sites or snorkels and the small groups plus naturalist just felt the right way to explore. This was an awesome trip packed with amazing experiences including hiking, snorkeling, kayaking and swimming. The naturalists were very well informed and provided interesting information both during their formal talks and informally on our many walks, zodiac trips, snorkeling etc. The staff were all enthusiastic, very pleasant and helpful.  The food was delicious and the chef and waiters went out of their way to accommodate my special dietary requirements. This trip was life-changing. I liked how informed the naturalists were and how they pointed out the wildlife and made opportunities for photography.  I also liked the evening lectures and films.  My cabin was extremely comfortable and the room staff were there to keep things orderly.  All needs were anticipated.  The equipment for snorkeling was excellent as were the opportunities to see fish and turtles Interactions with naturalists Knowledgeable guides, photo taking assistance, snorkeling, guests slide show, diverse wildlife and landscapes. naturalists were great, all staff were wonderful,  well organized, planned, appreciated daily options,  evening talks and films, food great-wish I could have done everything. The group director and all the other naturalists were very knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to answer questions.  The Galapagos Islands are a great place to visit because there is so much to see and do there, especially viewing the variety of animals.  Also, the group of people we traveled with was very compatible and interesting and we enjoyed many great conversations with them.  The activities were very well-organized and ran like clockwork. The incredible naturalists The naturalists impressive range of knowledge and the culinary experience the overall organization of the trip, professional approach to the itinerary, regular and consistent communications, depth and quality of staff, excellent food, and depth of resoruces on the ship The trip itself was great the back office however not so much.  It did not seem the staff new the excursion they were selling particularly the pre-trip and post cruise portions. 95% of the experience was INCREDIBLE! The wildlife, naturalists, hospitality of the cruise ship staff, food (personal favorites were 2/17 Galapagos lunch and dinners), ability to hop into your cabin to shower/change quickly before the next expedition or event. This was a trip of a lifetime. The travel packing list including buff neck gator, sun protection such as rash guard, hat, were all useful. Thank you! Almost everything.  The ship, crew, naturalists, excursions, food and fellow travelers Great crew! Very organized and kept us very well informed at all times! Staterooms were very comfortable and lots of interesting fellow passengers! The staff, Naturalist, crew , accommodations, professionalism, food, and the continuous schedule throughout the day.

The entire crew worked happily together, which indicates good leadership. I appreciated Anahí's photographic expertise. I loved Adriana's enthusiasm and connection with guests. Walter took especially good care of us in the dining room. Guests loved that Juan Carlos rewarded the good behavior of the two children on board. We appreciated that the captain loaned us his guitar during the trip. it was extremely well organized, it was so much fun, loved the planned activities, the staff were amazing, the ship was very clean they delivered exactly what what promised We felt comfortable and well taken care of during this trip.

The men who ran the zodiacs were highly skilled and helpful.  The transfers between flights and the ship were excellent. The naturalists were the best weve experienced, as they are native to Galapagos they know the history and creatures so well.  They were also skilled snorkelers and hikers and were extremely good at reacting to challenging situations in the water and on land.  The zodiac drivers were skilled and also good spotters. We got to see everything we expected to see and so much more. The naturalists were knowledgeable, engaging and friendly.

We were impressed with the staff: very knowledgeable, passenger focused, safety oriented, positive attitudes and high energy.

The itinerary was extraordinary and Carlos the expedition leader was better than any we have experienced in many years of travel The Galápagos Islands and all it has to offer, the naturalists and their point of view especially the local ones, the outings, and the ship The whole trip was exceptional and most professionally conducted. The Naturalist on board the Endeavour II were brilliant - patient and willing to share their knowledge. The coordination was immaculate and in the short time we got to see all that was offered. The icing on the cake was the presence of Dr Carl Safina whose talks on Evolution and Darwinism were outstanding and his deep knowledge was evidenced. Also having Jonathan Kingston to help with the photography was brilliant. Epic Trip Good Organisation

Well organized, great naturalists and guides, good food All of the logistics and itineraries were very well organized and the tour leaders for both the Galapagos (Carlos)and Peru (Celestino) were excellent, as were all of the naturalist guides in the Galapagos. Accommodations and meals on Endeavor II and In Peru were excellent and exceeded expectations. Everything was well organized and efficient.  5 star accommodations and food.  Even missed flights were handled better than expected. The service was incredible. I loved having so many activities and options from which to choose. I was impressed how the staff was careful to meet the needs of people of a range of abilities. While I could take advantage of the more active options, there were always equally fun options for people with less mobility. In the Andes, for example, our guides walked very slowly and paused frequently. They told us what to expect in detail. In short, they took very good care of us. The naturalists, with one exception, were outstanding in their enthusiasm and knowledge. They are why we chose National Geographic and they did not disappoint. The staff was very knowledgeable. Galápagos, guides where great. Very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.fantastic trip! Peru and Incas.same! No complaints.

Bud was great with keeping us informed and we thought the Captain was great. Amazing naturalists.  Great environment.  The ship crew and staff took fantastic care of us.

Overall it was a spectacular trip, made even better by the incredibly knowledgeable and interesting staff, whose enthusiasm was infectious.

Great staff, the Resolution is amazing and the commitment to education and science is very compelling. Impossible to narrow it down, it was so stellar in every way. The attention to detail (one companion has alpha gal and was blown away by the recall of the staff when it came to cautioning her or changing food), the genuine warmth and hospitality (Sebastian tracking us down a humidifier was one example), the efficiency of the crew and staff. The food was spectacular. My husband and I both having worked in service/hospitality, we know the level theyve reached, when it can look so effortless.

What I liked most was the friendly staff employed on the ship. Everyone from waiters, housekeeping, shop manager, desk attendants, were extremely pleasant and helpful. However, what made the trip for me were the technical staff employed to give lectures, interact with passengers, and answer questions you might have. For one, Tommy Heinrich went above and beyond to save my water-logged camera by drying it out and making it operable again. His friendship was invaluable and a highlight of the trip. The educational program and naturalists were excellent! The ship/hotel service was one of a kind. The people were kind and thoughtful. A truly memorable experience. The expedition leader, ship captain, naturalists, scientists, crew, household cleaning, food preparation, and other team members made the process look seamless.

The ship is outstanding, the staff incredible, the experience unique and everyone is focused on making the trip as amazing as possible getting the most out of landings, zodiac cruises, sightseeing.

The NG Explorer is a great ship with a wonderful crew from the captain down to all of the various service personnel. Food was excellent. The NG naturalists and photographers were knowledgeable, articulate, friendly yet professional, and patient. Michael, the expedition leader, was outstanding. Expedition style travel, wildlife, ice bergs mixed with professional lectures and on-board amenities. Loved the beauty of Antarctica, seeing the animals, hearing from the naturalists, the coordination of the zodiacs, hiking, kayaking and zodiac rides.

The experts on the trip and information they shared were excellent The ship (Endurance) and all hotel services.  The journey and the experiences off ship.  Even in the worst of the Drake passage I felt safe and the hotel staff took amazing care of us all.   The food was excellent, the majority of the naturalist staff was very good.  Incuuding alcohol and internet was genius since you did not feel as though you were being nickeled and died to death. I previously traveled to Antarctica with Lindblad/NatGeo in 2016. This was entirely different trip and was happy to have the opportunity to visit new places. EVERTHING This trip and the Lindblad staff exceeded all expectations. From a comfort perspective, all of our needs were anticipated and every detail extremely well thought out. From an expedition perspective, I was surprised and thrilled by the wealth of knowledge that staff shared with guests. They were professional, personable, and extremely knowledgeable.

This was especially true with bears and whales. Staff and crew on ship We loved the immersive experiences we had, the knowledge and personalities of the naturalists enhanced our experience as well.
